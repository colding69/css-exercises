I have mistakenly confused the "8px between edge of the card and its content (the blue section)" as border when it is referring to padding.

The next mistake is applying margin bottom to the butt-container element which added extra margin of 8px to the last block when there shouldn't have been any.

I should have also added margin-top 0 for the title block aka the first block to get rid of the big white extra margin on the top.
